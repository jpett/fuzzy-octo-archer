An animated one page website template.

So i got bored and decided to make a one page website template. Its not much and it comes with very few stylings out of the box.

It does however have the ability to add as many pages as you like(within reason).

Make sure you have jQuery and font-awesome for the arrows.

Then follow the simple-ish markup and youre away.
