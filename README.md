An animated one page website template.

So i got bored and decided to make a one page website template. 

A few stylings out of the box, basic typography, basic forms. (images and more to come).

It does however have the ability to add as many pages as you like(within reason).

Make sure you have jQuery and font-awesome for the arrows.

Then follow the simple-ish markup and youre away.
